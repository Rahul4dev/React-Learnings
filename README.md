# Rendering Name and Age inputs

_*Description*_

  - React project, here we just get input from user and render it.
  - We used css module to style them.
  - We have used proper architecture to make this project where every file is doing what they are meant.
  - Each component from UI to User, we can re-use them where ever we like. There is no code duplication and include proper error handling.
